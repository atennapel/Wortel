Programming language that compiles to Javascript.
This is the next version of Wortel.
I renamed it, since this version is quite different syntactically.

# Goals
* Optimized compiler
* Automatic partial application and composition
* Clean tacit programming
* Better chaining
* JS call and index syntax
